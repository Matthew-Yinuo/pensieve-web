                  Our short term memory is in a battle to retain the most relevant information. As
                  time goes by, it will naturally forget information that it doesn't think is
                  important. The trick to convincing your brain what information is important?
                  Revisiting that material. <br /> <br />Review and repetition are the key to
                  learning anything new. However, by studying at increasing intervals between each
                  review, you also will greatly reduce the amount of studying you do while improving
                  the long term retention of that material. Pensieve solves this problem of knowing
                  when to study by notifying you when your notes are ready to review. Allowing you
                  to remember anything quicker with less effort.

                    Once your cards expired, you will need to study them again, telling us how well
                    you remember them. The harder a card is to remember, the sooner you will see it
                    again.

                    This step is simple. Keep studying as your cards expire over longer and longer
